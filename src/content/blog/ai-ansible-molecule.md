### Context
Nowadays, there's no way of knowing the coverage status of an ansible role by using on of the most popular test framework: molecule

In this effort, we're trying to use an LLM model where we provide the ansible role code, the molecule code and an optional molecule execution log.
With this, we want to know:
* Deconstruct the Ansible Role: Where we're mapping out every "when" condition and variables that are related to them.
* Analyze molecule test scenarios: Platforms, variable overrides, verification steps...
* Perform correlation and gap analysis: We want to check which of the role tasks are covered, partial covered or not covered.

Repo: https://github.com/evallesp/llm-ansible-molecule-coverage

### Goals
With this we want to output a report where we have a:
* Summary: A one-paragraph of the overall test coverage status
* Coverage breakdown: Provide the analysis in CSV format
* Actionable recommendations: Provice specific and concrete solutions identifying gaps in CSV format
* Coverage score: Percentage from 0 to 100 of the coverage status.
* Confidence score: Percentage from 0 to 100 of the confidence in the anaylisis.

### What we've done
We've develop an ansible role that inspect each of the roles in an ansible role folder. The role output is a set of Markdown files, one per each role. These files contain a prompt we can use in any of the AI model UI.
It requires two variables: One for the ansible role folder path, and another one specifying the output folder.

The role use ansible for performing the steps:
* Checking required variables
* Executing python script: inspect_roles.py Which output is a python dict containing per each role the local URIs of all their meaningful files.
* Render a jinja2 template based on the output of the python script a prompt for each role.

### Output
After running the ansible role against virtualbmc role we get the following MD file containing the LLM prompt:

### 3.3. (Optional) Molecule Execution Logs
*No execution logs provided.*

## 4. Analysis Instructions

**Critically evaluate the provided information by following these steps:**

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Ansible Role
First, thoroughly analyze the role's source code. Do not output this preliminary analysis, but use it to build your final report.
- **Tasks & Handlers:** Systematically list every task and handler. Identify any `include_tasks`, `import_tasks`, and tasks within loops (`loop`, `with_*`). Note which tasks notify handlers.
- **Conditional Logic:** Map out every `when` condition. Note the variables that control these conditions.
- **Variables:** List all default variables and their values. Understand their purpose and impact on execution paths. Note any variables defined in `vars/`.
- **Templates:** Identify all templates and the variables they use.

### Step 2: Analyze the Molecule Test Scenarios
For each Molecule scenario provided:
- **Platforms:** Note the operating systems being tested (e.g., from `molecule.yml`).
- **Variable Overrides:** Identify all variables that are overridden in `converge.yml` or `molecule.yml`.
- **Verification Steps:** List the explicit checks performed by the verifier (e.g., `test_*.py` files or `verify.yml`). What states are being asserted? Are services running? Are files present with specific content?

### Step 3: Perform Correlation and Gap Analysis (Chain-of-Thought)
This is the most critical step. You must connect the role's logic to the test scenarios.
- For every task, handler, conditional path, and variable, determine if it is adequately tested by the combination of all Molecule scenarios.
- **State your reasoning clearly for each element.** Use the provided logs as concrete evidence. For example:
    - *"The task 'Install Apache on RedHat' is **NOT COVERED** because the Molecule scenarios only use Debian-based images, causing the condition `when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'` to always be false."*
    - *"The variable `httpd_port` is **PARTIALLY COVERED**. The role is tested with the default value (80), but no scenario overrides this variable to test a custom port configuration."*
    - *"The loop in 'Create user accounts' is **INSUFFICIENTLY TESTED**. The test provides a single user in the list, which does not cover the edge cases of an empty list or a list with multiple users."*
    - *"The handler 'Restart apache' is **COVERED**. The log snippet shows 'RUNNING HANDLER [Restart apache]'."*

# Ansible Role Coverage Report: Virtualbmc

### Executive Summary
Provide a concise, one-paragraph summary of the overall test coverage status. Highlight the most critical gaps found and the role's overall testability.

### Coverage Breakdown
Provide the analysis in a CSV format enclosed in a markdown code block. Use a semicolon (`;`) as the delimiter.

```csv
Element Type;Name/Condition;Covered?;Justification/Evidence
Task;Install Nginx;Yes;Converge playbook includes the role, and the verify playbook asserts the 'nginx' package is present and the service is running.
Condition;when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat";No;The provided Molecule scenarios only use Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22.04 platforms. The RedHat-specific tasks are never executed.
Variable;nginx_port;Partial;The role is tested with the default port (80), but no scenario provides a custom port to verify the template and service configuration are updated correctly.
Loop;Create virtual hosts;Partial;The test covers a single virtual host. It does not validate behavior with an empty list of vhosts (should do nothing) or a multi-vhost configuration.
Handler;Restart Nginx;Yes;The converge log shows the 'Configure Nginx' task notified this handler, and the handler executed successfully.
```

### Actionable Recommendations
Provide concrete, specific solutions for the identified gaps. Output as a CSV format enclosed in a markdown code block. Use a semicolon (`;`) as the delimiter.

```csv
Identified Gap;Recommended Solution;Example Snippet (for molecule.yml or converge.yml)
RedHat family tasks are untested.;Add a new Molecule platform for a RedHat-based OS like Rocky Linux or CentOS Stream.;"platforms:\n  - name: instance-rocky9\n    image: rockylinux/rockylinux:9"
Custom port configuration is untested.;Create a new Molecule scenario named 'custom_port'. In its `converge.yml`, override the `nginx_port` variable.;"vars:\n  nginx_port: 8080"
Loop behavior with an empty list is unknown.;Add an assertion to a verifier or a simple `converge_empty.yml` playbook that runs the role with the vhost list variable set to an empty array `[]`.;"vars:\n  nginx_vhosts: []"
```

### Coverage Score
**Score**: [Provide a percentage from 0 to 100]%
**Justification**: [Provide a one-paragraph explanation for the score, directly referencing the findings from the Coverage Breakdown. For example, mention the percentage of tasks covered, the significance of the untested conditional paths, and the impact of variable coverage.]

### Confidence Score
**Score**: [Provide a percentage from 0 to 100]%
**Justification**: [Provide a one-paragraph explanation for your confidence in the analysis. If information was missing (e.g., no logs, unclear verifier), state it here and explain how it impacts your confidence. For example: "Confidence is high due to the presence of detailed logs and explicit verifier checks. All execution paths could be confirmed or denied with evidence."]

### Disclaimer
If the analysis is inconclusive due to insufficient data (e.g., no `converge.yml`, no verifiers), please state what information is missing and why it is essential for a complete analysis.

### Ansible Role Coverage Report: Virtualbmc

#### Executive Summary
The virtualbmc role demonstrates good basic functionality coverage with successful deployment, container management, and host management operations. However, significant gaps exist in error handling, edge case testing, and comprehensive validation of all configuration parameters. The role lacks testing for failure scenarios, custom variable configurations, and comprehensive verification of generated configuration files. Critical areas like SSH key management, container restart scenarios, and IPMI connectivity validation are insufficiently tested.

#### Actionable Recommendations

#### Coverage Score
Score: 65%
Justification: The role achieves good coverage of core functionality with successful deployment, basic host management, and cleanup operations. However, significant gaps exist in edge case testing, error handling, and comprehensive variable validation. While primary execution paths are covered (container deployment, host add/delete, cleanup), critical areas like custom configurations, failure scenarios, container restart handling, and comprehensive verification are insufficiently tested. The lack of verify.yml execution and limited variable override testing particularly impact the score.

#### Confidence Score
Score: 85%
Justification: Confidence is high due to clear evidence from the converge.yml execution showing successful VBMC operations, IPMI connectivity, and VM state management. The test scenarios provide concrete evidence of task execution and state changes. However, confidence is slightly reduced by the absence of verify.yml execution logs and limited testing of edge cases. The provided code structure is comprehensive enough to assess most coverage gaps with reasonable certainty.

#### Disclaimer
The analysis is based on the provided role code and single Molecule scenario. Additional confidence would be gained from: (1) execution logs showing verify.yml task execution, (2) additional test scenarios covering edge cases and custom configurations, and (3) more comprehensive verifier checks validating generated configuration files and container state persistence across restarts.
